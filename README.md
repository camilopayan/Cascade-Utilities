#Cascade Utilities!

Random bits of code for [Cascade Server](http://www.hannonhill.com/products/ "It's
okay"). Some of it is in python, some of it is in XSLT. More languages and stuff
might be coming as I decide to use them.

##Python Utilities

These are all webservice-based utilities, which do various things like

* Converting from LDAP to CAS (Central Auth)
* Getting all Users, which is dependent on every active user being in a common group.

##XSLT Utilities
Useful XSLT scripts to import around your site.

* Popular video site parser. Trust me, it's useful.
